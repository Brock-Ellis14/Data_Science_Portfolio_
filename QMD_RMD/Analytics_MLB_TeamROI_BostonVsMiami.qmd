This next analysis will focus on the Boston Red Sox and the Miami Marlins from 2005 to 2016, using wins per $1 million in player salary as a measure of team efficiency or return on investment (ROI). 

The results below showed that the Marlins consistently had a significantly higher ROI than the Red Sox, often achieving more wins per dollar spent despite having one of the league’s lowest payrolls. In contrast, the Red Sox had a much lower and more consistent ROI throughout the same period. Interestingly, Boston won the World Series twice during this window—once in 2007 and again in 2013—yet those championship seasons did not correspond to spikes in efficiency. This indicates that a team's ROI during the regular season is not necessarily predictive of postseason success. While the Marlins outperformed Boston in terms of spending efficiency, they did not win a single World Series during the period analyzed.

```{python}

query = pd.read_sql_query("""
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN t.teamID = 'FLO' THEN 'MIA'
        ELSE t.teamID 
    END AS teamID,
    t.yearID,
    t.name,
    SUM(s.salary) AS total_salary,
    t.W AS wins,
    t.L AS losses
FROM teams t
JOIN salaries s 
    ON t.teamID = s.teamID AND t.yearID = s.yearID
WHERE t.teamID IN ('BOS', 'MIA', 'FLO') AND s.yearID > 2004
GROUP BY t.teamID, t.yearID, t.name, t.W, t.L
ORDER BY t.yearID;
""", con)

query['wins_per_million'] = query['wins'] / (query['total_salary'] / 1_000_000)

annotations = pd.DataFrame({
    'yearID': [2008.5, 2014.5],
    'wins_per_million': [query['wins_per_million'].max() * 0.9] * 2,
    'label': ['BOS wins World Series', 'BOS wins World Series']
})
```
```{python}
ggplot(query, aes(x='yearID', y='wins_per_million', color='teamID')) + \
    geom_line(size=1) + \
    geom_point() + \
    geom_vline(xintercept=2007, color='red', linetype='dashed', size=.5) + \
    geom_vline(xintercept=2013, color='red', linetype='dashed', size=.5) + \
    geom_text(aes(x='yearID', y='wins_per_million', label='label'), 
        size=4, data=annotations, color='red', fontface='bold') + \
    ggtitle("Wins per $1M Salary: Boston Red Sox vs Miami Marlins") + \
    xlab("Year") + ylab("Wins per Million Dollars") + \
    scale_x_continuous(format="d") + \
    theme_bw()
```

Overall, the results suggest that while ROI is a useful metric for measuring regular season cost-effectiveness, it does not capture the full picture of what drives postseason championships.

Next, we examine what the ROI graph implies: Does higher spending lead to better regular-season or postseason performance? Is there a measurable relationship between salary and wins?

```{python}
bos_mean_wins = query.query("teamID == 'BOS'")['wins'].mean()
mia_mean_wins = query.query("teamID == 'MIA'")['wins'].mean()

print(f"BOS mean wins per season: {bos_mean_wins:.2f}")
print(f"MIA mean wins per season: {mia_mean_wins:.2f}")


ggplot(query, aes(x='teamID', y='wins', fill='teamID')) + \
  geom_boxplot() + \
  ggtitle(f"Wins by team (2005–2016)") + \
    xlab("Teams") + \
    ylab("Wins per Season") + \
    theme_bw()
```
```{python}
bos_mean = query.query("teamID == 'BOS'")['total_salary'].mean()
mia_mean = query.query("teamID == 'MIA'")['total_salary'].mean()

print(f"BOS mean salary per season: ${bos_mean:,.0f}")
print(f"MIA mean salary per season: ${mia_mean:,.0f}")

query['salary_millions'] = query['total_salary'] / 1_000_000

ggplot(query, aes(x='teamID', y='salary_millions', fill='teamID')) + \
  geom_boxplot() + \
  ggtitle("Team Salary (2005–2016)") + \
  xlab("Team") + \
  ylab("Total Salary (Millions)") + \
  theme_bw()
```

```{python}

(
    ggplot(query, aes(x='salary_millions', y='wins', color='teamID'))
    + geom_point(size=4, alpha=0.7)
    + geom_smooth(method='lm')
    + ggtitle("Wins vs. Salary per Season (2005–2016)")
    + xlab("Total Salary (Millions USD)")
    + ylab("Wins per Season")
    + theme_bw()
)
```

The first boxplot confirms that the Red Sox consistently outperformed the Marlins in regular-season wins between 2005 and 2016. On average, Boston achieved 87.83 wins per season, while Miami averaged just 76.08. On the other hand, BOS's mean salary expenditure person was significantly higher than MIA's- with BOS being $149,913,559 compared to MIA's $51,424,50. These results reinforce that higher payrolls are often associated with better regular-season outcomes, though they do not necessarily indicate spending efficiency or postseason success. If you can notice, these box-plots seem to be similarly positioned on the graph in relation to one another. Does this indicate a linear relationship between salary and win success?

```{python}
correlation = query[['total_salary', 'wins']].corr().loc['total_salary', 'wins']
print(f"Correlation between salary and wins: {correlation:.3f}")

correlation_loss = query[['total_salary', 'losses']].corr().loc['total_salary', 'losses']
print(f"Correlation between salary and losses: {correlation_loss:.3f}")

df = query.dropna(subset=['total_salary', 'wins']).copy()
df['salary_millions'] = df['total_salary'] / 1_000_000

ggplot(df, aes(x='salary_millions', y='wins', color='teamID')) + \
    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.7) + \
    geom_smooth(method='lm', se=False, color='black', linetype='dashed') + \
    ggtitle(f"Wins vs Total Salary (2005–2016)\nr = {correlation:.3f}") + \
    xlab("Total Salary (in Millions USD)") + \
    ylab("Wins") + \
    theme_bw()
```

The correlation coefficient (r = 0.415) indicates a moderate positive linear relationship between total salary and regular-season wins. This suggests that as team payroll increases, win totals tend to increase as well — though the relationship is not strong enough to be predictive.

In conclusion, this analysis found a moderate positive correlation between total salary and regular-season wins from 2005 to 2016, meaning that higher-spending teams generally achieved more wins. However, the analysis also revealed that Return on Investment (ROI) — measured as wins per $1 million spent — was not predictive of postseason success. For example, the Miami Marlins consistently outperformed the Boston Red Sox in ROI, yet failed to win a single World Series during this period. Meanwhile, the Red Sox had significantly lower ROI but secured two championships. This suggests that while spending more can improve regular-season performance, postseason outcomes rely on other strategic factors beyond spending efficiency.
