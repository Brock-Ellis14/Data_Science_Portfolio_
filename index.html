            <h2>Featured Projects</h2>

            <h3>üè† Predicting Home Age with Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Built classification and regression models to predict whether a home was built before 1980 and estimate its construction year. 
                Gradient Boosting achieved 94% accuracy (classification) and R¬≤ = 0.87 (regression), showing strong predictive performance. 
                Demonstrates skills in feature selection, model tuning, and interpretation of feature importance in real estate data.

            <h3>üß¨ Gene Expression Analysis in Multiple Sclerosis</h3>
            <p>
                Analyzed expression levels of immune-related genes (CXCL10, IL7R, CD19, TNF) between MS patients and controls using R. 
                Found CXCL10 significantly associated with MS status (p = 0.01). Demonstrates hypothesis testing, data wrangling, 
                and logistic regression modeling for biomedical data.

            <h3>‚öæ ROI Baseball Analytics</h3>
            <p>
                Explored the relationship between MLB team payroll and performance using 150+ years of Lahman data. 
                SQL and Python models showed payroll predicts regular-season wins but not championships‚Äîillustrating 
                diminishing returns of spending. Combines data engineering, financial modeling, and regression analysis.

            <h3>üåå Star Wars Predictive Analytics</h3>
            <p>
                Predicted whether survey respondents earned over $50K using Star Wars fan preference data. 
                Tested Random Forest, KNN, and Gradient Boosting (70% accuracy). Demonstrates end-to-end data cleaning, 
                feature engineering, and model evaluation on real categorical data.
